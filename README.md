# Deep Learning-Based Structural Crack Detection for Edge Devices

## Overview

Modernization and urbanization have led to a surge in high-rise buildings and complex structures like bridges, dams, and factories. Identifying cracks caused by aging and environmental factors is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of these assets. This project aims to address this challenge using advanced deep learning techniques.

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to develop an automated system for crack detection in structures using deep learning. The system employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning to accurately detect and segment cracks. The project also focuses on optimizing the models for deployment on edge devices.

## Key Features

- **Deep Learning Models**: Utilized CNN architectures including InceptionV3, MobileNet, VGG-16, and ResNet50 for crack detection.
- **Segmentation**: Integrated YOLOv5 for precise crack segmentation and localization.
- **Edge Optimization**: Conducted performance analysis to identify the best model for edge devices, selecting MobileNet for its lightweight architecture combined with YOLOv5 for bounding boxes.
